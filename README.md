Minimal AI-powered Document Intelligence and Contradiction Detection

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation (Start Here)

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### 1️⃣ Clone this repository

You can fork it first or clone directly:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/satyam-mohanty/knot.git
cd knot
2️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install


or

yarn install

3️⃣ Add your Gemini API Key

Your project includes a utils folder.

Create or replace the file:

.env.local
Inside it, add:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_real_api_key_here


🔒 Make sure .env.local stays out of GitHub.

4️⃣ Update the AI model for best results

Find the code where Gemini requests are made.
It will look like:

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({ 
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  contents: {
    // your prompt or data
  }
});


Change it to:

model: "gemini-2.5-pro"


Ensure your API key is loaded correctly.

5️⃣ Run the development server
npm run dev


Then open:

http://localhost:3000


Your app should now be running.

## 🧠 **What is knot?**

**knot** is a minimal AI-driven web application that analyzes long policy and contract documents to detect contradictions between clauses. It is designed as a sharp, lightweight MVP suitable for hackathons and early product prototyping.

Users can upload documents, and the system:

- Segments text into meaningful clauses  
- Finds semantically similar clauses  
- Detects contradictions  
- Classifies conflict types  
- Explains the issue in readable language  

The goal is to make reviewing dense legal or policy text **faster, clearer, and more reliable.**

## 🚀 **Core Features**

- Upload multiple documents  
- Automatic clause segmentation  
- Semantic contradiction detection  
- Classification of conflict types  
- Severity scoring  
- Human-readable explanations  
- Clean review dashboard

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node / API routes  
- **AI:** Gemini API  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  

---

## 🧪 **How It Works (High Level)**

1. User uploads one or more documents  
2. Text is extracted and split into clauses  
3. Clauses are semantically analyzed  
4. Similar clauses are matched  
5. Logical and numerical contradictions are detected  
6. Findings are displayed with severity and explanation

## ⚠️ **Disclaimer**

This tool does **not** replace legal review.  
It is intended as a **decision-support assistant only.**

## 🛤 **Roadmap**

- PDF export for reports  
- Role-based access  
- Better clause scoring  
- Highlighting inside text  
- Domain-tuned improvements
